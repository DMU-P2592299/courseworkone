<p id="Synopsis"> Olivia Wilde’s electric feature debut, “Booksmart,” is a stellar high school comedy with an A+ cast, a brilliant script loaded with witty dialogue, eye-catching cinematography, swift editing, and a danceable soundtrack. Most importantly, it’s incredibly fun to watch again and again. The story follows two overachieving students Amy and Molly, who on the eve of their high school graduation decide to go all out for fun and debauchery in a single night. Hilarity ensues as they seek to make up for lost time.</p>
